# Pacemaker-Graphical-User-Interface

The graphical User Interface was a project completed by myself and my partner which involved creating a fullstack for users to access a pacemaker directory. 
The GUI could take up to 20 usernames and passwords (whilst storing them), and could alter the pacemaker settings. 

Main languages used for this were JS, CSS, and HTML.
